Grid2 is fully customizable. New zones (indicators) can be defined in unit frames to display information (statuses). The indicators can be customized and placed anywhere.

Common issues/FAQ
Grid2 Doesn't Load after Update
If you are updating Grid2 from r560 or older version, you must reset your saved variables (you will lose all your settings), you must see a message in chat window explaining how to reset saved variables.

Raid debuffs not showing up !!!:
Raid debuffs are not enabled by default. Go to statuses -> Raid Debuffs and enable at least the Cataclysm module (if you are inside a instance you must exit and enter the instance or reload the UI after enabling the module)

I cant push the grid boxes as close together as before:
The border indicator has 2 pixels size and it has a transparent background color now. If you want the old grid2 appearance. Goto Indicators -> border -> Layout tab: Set a border size 1. And select a black and opaque background color for the border.

What about mana bars ?
Grid2 supports mana bars, but they are not created by default. If you want mana bars, create a new indicator of type "bar", place it wherever you want and map the "mana" or the "power" status to it (remember you must map some color status to the bar:color indicator too).

What is the poweralt status ?
Poweralt status is a power type (like mana/rage/energy,etc). This power type is enabled by Wow in some combats. It shows: Atremedes sound, Chog'al corruption, etc. This status is not active by default in Grid2: you must map poweralt to any compatible indicator (text or bar indicator).
